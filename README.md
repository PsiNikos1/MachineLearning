About clustering:

The database consists of 4000 folders,each folder for each individual person.Also in each folder there are many photos of the same individual. Our goal is to select 10    random people with 50 photos each and try to apply Kmeans & Agglomerative Clusteringd Algorithms.In order to do that,we apply the PCA( dimension reduction )algorithm in  the pixels of  the photo.
In order to run my programm you need to install the database from kaggle,(link to the website is in the .pdf file). After that you just need to run the main         function which is written in FaceRecognisionClustering.py file.
